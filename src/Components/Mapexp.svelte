    <span class="highlight">H</span>owever, It is still 
    hard to see the in depth distribution in daytime and nighttime. Letâ€™s look into dot distribution with a map of Camden,
     UK. Light pink represents a low number of accidents and dark
      red represents a high number of accidents. You can use 
      Daytime and Nighttime button to compare the numbers of
       accidents in each area either in day time or night time.

    The pie chart above provides a clear representation of the distribution of accident severities. 
    From the chart, we can observe that the majority of accidents fall into the <span class='level'>'slight'</span> severity category, 
    which dominates the pie with a substantial portion. Specifically, <span class='level'>'slight'</span> accidents account for 6890 
    out of the total 7812 incidents, making it the <span class='underline'>most prevalent</span> severity level. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In contrast, <span class='level'>'serious'</span> accidents are significantly less common, with a count of 897. 
    This indicates that while these accidents are more severe than <span class='level'>'slight'</span> ones, they occur much less frequently. 
    The <span class='underline'>least common</span> severity level is <span class='level'>'fatal'</span>, with only 25 incidents recorded. This suggests that while fatal 
    accidents are the most severe, they are thankfully rare compared to the other categories.
    <br>
    <br>
    By examining these proportions, we gain a better understanding of how accident severities are distributed overall. 
    The predominance of <span class='level'>'slight'</span> accidents highlights the relative safety of most incidents, while the smaller percentages 
    of <span class='level'>'serious'</span> and <span class='level'>'fatal'</span> accidents remind us of the potential dangers on the roads.

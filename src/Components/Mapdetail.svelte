    <list>
        <li> <span class='highlight'>Daytime</span> has higher counts of accidents than nighttime as total accident counts in daytime is <span class='level'>4966</span>, 
            while nighttime has total accident counts of  <span class='level'>2846</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li> Intersections have higher accident rates than any other types of road </li>
        <br>
    </list>
    <br>
    These patterns show that Daytime has a higher accident rates due to high volumne of car traffic during daytime while there is significantly less poeple driving around at nighttime.
    Also, intersections have the highest accident rate due to several reasons including speeding, fail to notice other cars, and confusion with traffic lights' signals.

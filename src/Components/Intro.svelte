    <span class="bold"></span> We were interested in researching about the how does time of the day affects car accidents rate, and we used car accidents data in Camdens, UK. 
    We created a line chart with d3 and svelte scrolly so that the graphs gets drawn when we scroll down. We also have created a map chart with dots on it utilizing d3 and mapbox. 
    You can see the accidents frequency that happened day time and night time, and it contains zoom function, count function, and resizing accidents counting area. We also have created a bar chart that allows user to compare accidentsâ€™ 
    severity between day time and night time accidents. The most Challenging part of the project is going go be making map visualization and bar chart interactive and making transition smooth. As the buttons of night and day time have to
    change the design of maps and bar chart data design, it is going to be challenging.

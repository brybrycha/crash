    The visualization above depicts the accident rates at various times throughout the day. 
    From the chart, we can observe distinct peak times:
    <br><br>
    <list>
        <li>The first noticeable peak occurs around <span class='level'>8:00 AM</span>, 
            coinciding with the morning rush hour when traffic is typically heavier as people commute to work or school.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Another significant peak is observed around <span class='level'>5:00 PM</span>, aligning with the evening rush hour 
            as people return home from their daily activities.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The graph also shows a mid-day increase in accident rates around <span class='level'>1:00 PM</span>, 
            which could be attributed to lunchtime traffic and increased movement on the roads.</li>
    </list>
    <br>
    These patterns suggest that rush hours, both in the morning and evening, have a <span class='underline'>notable impact</span> on accident rates. 
    During these times, higher traffic volumes likely contribute to the increased number of accidents. 
    This insight emphasizes the importance of heightened awareness and caution during these peak traffic periods to reduce the risk of accidents.

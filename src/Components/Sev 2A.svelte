    From our observation, the time of the day <span class='underline'>does not</span> appear to have a significant impact on the distribution of accident severities. 
    The bar chart shows that for each severity level—slight, serious, and fatal—the proportions of <span class='day'>daytime</span> and <span class='night'>nighttime</span> accidents are <span class='underline'>relatively similar</span>.
   
    <br><br>

    For <span class='level'>'slight'</span> accidents, which are the most common, we see that 63.4% occur during the <span class='day'>daytime</span>, while 36.6% happen at <span class='night'>night</span>. 
    <span class='level'>'serious'</span> accidents follow a similar pattern, with 64.4% occurring during the <span class='day'>day</span> and 35.6% at <span class='night'>night</span>. 
    Even for <span class='level'>'fatal'</span> accidents, the distribution is close, with 68.0% happening during the <span class='day'>day</span> and 32.0% at <span class='night'>night</span>.
    
    <br><br>

    These consistent proportions across different times of the day suggest that the severity of accidents is <span class='underline'>not significantly 
    influenced</span> by whether it is <span class='day'>day</span> or <span class='night'>night</span>. This might indicate that factors other than the time of day, such as road conditions, 
    driver behavior, and traffic volume, play a more crucial role in determining the severity of accidents.
   
    <br><br>

    By examining the bar chart, we can conclude that while the time of day may contribute to the likelihood of accidents occurring, 
    it does not drastically change the severity distribution. This insight helps us understand that improving road safety requires a multifaceted approach, 
    addressing various factors beyond just the time of day.
